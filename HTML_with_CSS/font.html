        Hello, World!
        <p>Here we have added a border and fonts to our div tag separated by comma if one is not supported in user laptop then the other can be used as i my laptop first font is not supported so it moves to the next font</p>
        <p>Next we have added font size in pixel</p>
        <p>After that we added some properties like bold,italic etc</p>
        </div>
        <p>Thank you for visiting here also this is not effected bu style nd we can see the diff bw both</p>
